I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Radiology at Peking University Third Hospital, under the supervision of [Professor Hongbin Han](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/hongbin_han/bio).

My doctoral research focuses on the structural and functional properties of the brain extracellular space (ECS), with the goal of elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic targets for brain disorders.

You can find my CV here: [Yanni Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
